               <p>Hi everyone, do you know that I am cheerful and good at dancing since I was a child, I am also difficult to plant and water plants, this calms me down and I like to read stories especially if it excites me<\p>
    
                 <h2> My Insight </h2>
                 <p>Creating the website is both exciting and challenging, Through this process, I learned HTML coding, content organization, how to add personal information, and how to enhance the website's simplicity.One of my first tasks was to add personal information. I created an "About" section to introduce myself, outline my skills, and provide a brief biography. I used HTML tags like < h1 >, < h 2 >, and < p > to create headings and paragraphs
learned to add images using the < img > tag. The src attribute specifies the image path, and the alt attribute describes the image. but in my phone it's not working so next to make my website look better I use simple color and font. Creating a simple website was a wonderful experience because I present my work and I continue to gain more skills and experience also my confidence, I hope in future I can build website with my Own business.
